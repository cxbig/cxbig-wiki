## Tricks


### Run command in different folder

```sh
# 1. Use CD and command in one line, just add '&&' between them.
cd /path/to/folder/ && ls -a

# 2. Command above will change folder to destination and run LS command
#    If you want to do that but do not change folder, you can add a parenthesis:
(cd /path/to/folder/ && ls -a)
```


## Shortcut

- `Ctrl` + `l`					Clean screen
